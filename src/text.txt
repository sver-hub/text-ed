In Linux, Logical Volume Manager 	(LVM) is a device 	mapper target that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel.
 Most modern Linux distributions are LVM-aware 	to the point of being 
able to have their root file 	systems on a logical volume.[3][4][5]

Heinz Mauelshagen wrote the original LVM code in 1998, when he 
was working at Sistina Software, 
taking its primary 
design guidelines from 
the HP-UX's volume manager.[1]
